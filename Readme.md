# 📚 Pratik’s DSA & C++ Repo🚀

Hey! 👋 Welcome to my DSA & C++ journey! This repo has all the code I’m writing as I dive into **Data Structures and Algorithms** with **C++**. It’s like my personal coding diary — full of experiments, problem-solving, and growth in DSA.

## 🌟 What’s Inside?

This repo has everything from basics to advanced topics in DSA. Here’s the layout:

- **📁 Basics** — Simple stuff to get started (arrays, strings, pointers).
- **📁 Intermediate** — Stepping it up with stacks, queues, recursion, etc.
- **📁 Advanced** — Trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and other deep dives.

Each folder has:

- **Code** — My practice problems, exercises, and mini-projects.
- **Notes** — Takeaways, observations, and any tips I found helpful.

## 🛠️ How I’m Tackling This

1. **Concept**: Understand the basics of each topic.
2. **Practice**: Solve problems to lock in each concept.
3. **Reflect**: Write down key takeaways, mistakes, and lessons learned.
