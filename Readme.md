# DSA and C++ Learning Repository
Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and C++ Learning Repository! This repository contains my journey through learning DSA and C++ as I work through various coding problems and practice implementing different algorithms and data structures.

## About
This repository serves as a record of my learning progress in DSA and C++. Here, Iâ€™ll be adding solutions to problems, along with my explanations and notes. Each section covers important DSA topics, which will help in understanding the foundational concepts of computer science and programming.

## Repository Structure
Data Structures: Implementations of various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more.
Algorithms: Solutions and explanations for algorithms including sorting, searching, dynamic programming, recursion, backtracking, etc.
C++ Code Snippets: Useful C++ code snippets and examples to understand syntax, language features, and best practices.
Topics Covered
The repository is divided into the following sections:

# Data Structures:

Arrays
Linked Lists
Stacks and Queues
Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL, etc.)
Graphs
Hashing and Hash Tables
Heaps
# Algorithms:

Sorting (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)
Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, Fibonacci, etc.)
Recursion and Backtracking
Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's, etc.)
C++ Basics:
